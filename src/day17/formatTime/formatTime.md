# Format Time

### Challenge

Using the JavaScript language, have the function FormatTime(time) take the num parameter
being passed in, which can either be 1 or a 2 digit number between 0 and 59. The goal is to try format that number as a time value, thus a single digit value like 9 becomes '09' and double digit value remains the same, but as a string.

### Sample Test Cases

Input: 9
Output: "09"

Input: 0
Output: "00"

Input: 32
Output: "32"
